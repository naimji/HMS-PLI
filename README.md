HMS-PLI: A Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework for Protein-Ligand Interaction Prediction with Hierarchical Multi-Scale Encoding


Abstract
Proteinâ€“ligand interactions (PLIs) are fundamental to understanding cellular signaling, drug efficacy, and molecular recognition, making their accurate prediction essential for computational drug discovery. However, traditional experimental methods for identifying PLIs are often costly, time-intensive, and limited in scalability, highlighting the need for efficient computational alternatives. In this study, we propose HMS-PLI, a novel deep learning framework that integrates a Hierarchical Multi-Scale (HMS) encoding strategy with an advanced multi-task architecture to enhance PLI prediction. Our HMS encoding integrates four complementary strategies: one-hot sequence identity, physicochemical properties, sinusoidal positional encoding, and multi-scale context features, transforming variable-length sequences into rich numerical representations that capture information across multiple biological organizational scales. The deep learning architecture incorporates three core innovations: Adaptive Multi-Head Attention (AMHA) for dynamic feature weighting, a Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (HFFN) to model multi-scale interactions, and Task-Adaptive Gating (TAG) to handle classification and regression tasks within a unified model. Evaluated across five benchmark datasets, the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art computational methods, and it can effectively perform dual-task prediction of both protein-ligand interaction and binding affinity with superior generalization capability. These findings indicate that HMS-PLI offers a powerful and scalable solution for accurate and generalizable PLI prediction using only raw protein sequences and ligand SMILES strings.
